# Flutter Build Troubleshooting Guide

## NDK Issues

The error you're encountering:
```
[CXX1101] NDK at C:\Users\kayam_drhfn9o\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\ndk\26.3.11579264 did not have a source.properties file
```

This indicates that the NDK installation is incomplete or corrupted.

### Solution 1: Delete Corrupted NDK and Reinstall

1. Navigate to:
   ```
   C:\Users\kayam_drhfn9o\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\ndk\
   ```

2. Delete the folder:
   ```
   26.3.11579264
   ```

3. Open Android Studio:
   - Go to Settings (Ctrl+Alt+S)
   - Navigate to Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK
   - Click on SDK Tools tab
   - Uncheck "NDK (Side by side)"
   - Click Apply and OK
   - Restart Android Studio
   - Go back to SDK Tools
   - Check "NDK (Side by side)" again
   - Click Apply and OK

### Solution 2: Use Flutter's Built-in NDK Management

Modify the android/app/build.gradle.kts file:

```kotlin
android {
    namespace = "com.example.fin_agentix_flutter"
    compileSdk = flutter.compileSdkVersion
    // Remove or comment out this line:
    // ndkVersion = flutter.ndkVersion
    
    // Add this instead:
    ndkVersion = "25.1.8937393"
    
    // ... rest of the configuration
}
```

### Solution 3: Set NDK Path Explicitly

Add to your system environment variables:
```
ANDROID_NDK_HOME=C:\Users\kayam_drhfn9o\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\25.1.8937393
```

## Alternative Build Methods

### Method 1: Split ABI Build
This creates smaller APKs for specific architectures:
```
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

### Method 2: Build App Bundle (for Google Play)
```
flutter build appbundle
```

### Method 3: Debug Build (for testing)
```
flutter build apk --debug
```

## General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Update Flutter**:
   ```
   flutter upgrade
   ```

2. **Check Flutter Doctor**:
   ```
   flutter doctor -v
   ```

3. **Clean Project**:
   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Check Android SDK**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to SDK Manager
   - Ensure all required SDK tools are installed

5. **Increase Gradle Memory**:
   Create or edit `android/gradle.properties`:
   ```
   org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4G
   ```

## If All Else Fails

1. **Use a Cloud Build Service**:
   - Codemagic
   - Bitrise
   - GitHub Actions

2. **Try on a Different Machine**:
   - The issue might be specific to your current development environment

3. **Use Expo's EAS Build**:
   If you prefer to stick with Expo:
   ```
   npm install -g eas-cli
   eas build -p android
   ```
