# Fixed Navigation Duplication Issue

## Problem Identified
The admin dashboard was showing "Consumption Loans" multiple times in the navigation, causing confusion for users. This was happening because:

1. The main navigation had an item labeled "Consumption Loans" linking to `/admin/consumption`
2. The consumption page itself had tabs including "Consumption Loans", creating duplication

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Admin Navigation Component
**File:** `src/components/admin/AdminNavigation.tsx`

- Changed the navigation item from "consumption" to "consumption_loans" for clarity
- Updated the translation key to use `navigation.${item.name}` for better consistency
- Made labels more descriptive to avoid confusion

### 2. Updated Translation Files
**File:** `public/locales/en/common.json`

- Added specific navigation labels for all admin sections:
  - "marketplace" → "Marketplace"
  - "partners" → "Partners"
  - "consumption_loans" → "Consumption Loans"
  - "loan_applications" → "Loan Applications"
  - "products" → "Products"
  - "loan_schemes" → "Loan Schemes"
  - "disbursements" → "Disbursements"
  - "settings" → "Settings"

### 3. Updated Main Navigation
**File:** `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`

- Renamed admin navigation items to be more specific:
  - "consumption_partners" for the partners section
  - "consumption_marketplace_admin" for the marketplace
  - "consumption_loans" for the consumption loans section

### 4. Improved Consumption Page Tabs
**File:** `src/app/admin/consumption/page.tsx`

- Renamed tabs to be more descriptive:
  - "Partner Management" instead of just "Partners"
  - "Loan Disbursement" instead of just "Consumption Loans"
- Updated section titles to provide better context

## Results

The navigation duplication issue has been resolved. Now the admin interface has:

1. **Clear Main Navigation**: Each section has a unique, descriptive label
2. **Consistent Terminology**: All navigation items use consistent naming
3. **No Duplication**: "Consumption Loans" appears only once in the main navigation
4. **Better User Experience**: Users can easily identify where to find specific functionality

## Verification

The changes have been tested and verified:
- All navigation links work correctly
- Translations are properly applied
- The consumption page tabs are clearly labeled
- No duplication of labels in the interface

The admin dashboard now provides a cleaner, more intuitive navigation experience.
