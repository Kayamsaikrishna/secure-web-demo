## Solutions to Generate APK

### Option 1: Cloud-Based Build Services (Recommended)

#### GitHub Actions
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Build APK
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
         with:
           java-version: '11'
           distribution: 'temurin'
       - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
         with:
           flutter-version: '3.24.0'
       - run: flutter pub get
       - run: flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
       - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: release-apk
           path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-*-release.apk
   ```

#### Codemagic
1. Sign up at https://codemagic.io
2. Connect your repository
3. Configure build settings:
   - Workflow editor: Select "Flutter app"
   - Build for: Android
   - Script: `flutter build apk --release`
4. Trigger build and download APK

### Option 2: Use a Machine with More Resources

Requirements for successful local build:
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- 10GB free disk space
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android SDK installed

### Option 3: Optimized Local Build

Try our optimized build script:
- [build_apk_optimized.bat](file:///D:/KAYAM_SAI_KRISHNA/dem/secure-web-demo/finagentix_flutter_app/finagentix_flutter/build_apk_optimized.bat)

Optimizations applied:
- Reduced memory allocation in gradle.properties
- Target specific architecture only
- Disable icon tree shaking

### Option 4: Flutter Web Version

Convert to web app for immediate access:
```
flutter build web
```

Benefits:
- No installation required
- Accessible on any device with a browser
- No storage space needed on device

Drawbacks:
- Requires internet connection
- May have limited functionality compared to native app

### Option 5: Split APKs

Build separate APKs for each architecture:
```
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

This creates smaller APKs:
- app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk (older devices)
- app-arm64-v8a-release.apk (modern devices)
- app-x86_64-release.apk (emulators)

## Installation Methods

### Direct APK Transfer
1. Transfer APK to device via:
   - Email attachment
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
   - USB cable
   - Bluetooth
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in device settings
3. Open APK file and tap "Install"

### QR Code Distribution
1. Upload APK to a file sharing service
2. Generate QR code for download link
3. Scan QR code on device to download and install

## Next Steps

### Immediate Access
