# Complete Android Studio Solution for FinAgentix Flutter App

## Overview

This guide provides a complete solution for building and running the FinAgentix Flutter app in Android Studio, avoiding both NDK and memory issues you've encountered.

## Prerequisites

1. Android Studio installed
2. Flutter plugin enabled in Android Studio
3. Android device or emulator ready

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Fix NDK Issue

The error indicates a corrupted NDK installation:
```
[CXX1101] NDK at C:\Users\kayam_drhfn9o\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\ndk\26.3.11579264 did not have a source.properties file
```

**Fix in Android Studio:**
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Settings (Ctrl+Alt+S)
3. Navigate to Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK
4. Click on "SDK Tools" tab
5. Uncheck "NDK (Side by side)" and click "Apply"
6. Restart Android Studio
7. Go back to SDK Tools
8. Check "NDK (Side by side)" again
9. Click "Apply" to reinstall

### Step 2: Open Project in Android Studio

1. Run `open_in_android_studio.bat` or manually open:
   ```
   D:\KAYAM_SAI_KRISHNA\dem\secure-web-demo\fin-agentix-flutter\fin_agentix_flutter
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Memory Settings

In Android Studio, configure memory settings:
1. Go to Help → Edit Custom VM Options
2. Add or modify these lines:
   ```
   -Xmx2G
   -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
   -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=256m
   ```

### Step 4: Run the App

1. Connect your Android device or start an emulator
2. Select your device from the dropdown
3. Click the green "Run" button (▶)

### Step 5: Build APK for Distribution

1. Go to Build → Flutter → Build APK
2. Wait for completion
3. Find the APK at:
   ```
   build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
   ```

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Avoids NDK Issues**: Android Studio manages NDK automatically
2. **Memory Optimized**: Proper VM settings prevent out-of-memory errors
3. **No Command Line**: Uses Android Studio's built-in tools
4. **Reliable Builds**: More stable than command-line builds

## Benefits of This Solution

- **No QR Codes**: Standalone APK installation
- **Offline Functionality**: Works without constant internet
- **Easy Distribution**: Direct file sharing
- **Professional UI**: Complete app implementation

## Troubleshooting

### If NDK Issues Persist

1. Delete the corrupted NDK folder manually:
   ```
   C:\Users\kayam_drhfn9o\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\ndk\26.3.11579264
   ```

2. Reinstall via Android Studio SDK Manager

### If Memory Issues Persist

1. Close other applications
2. Restart your computer
3. Increase virtual memory in Windows settings
